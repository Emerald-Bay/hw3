In directory hw3, use the commands <make all> to make all of the executables
needed for part one and the heap section. 

For the logicsim section, enter the logicsim directory and use the command <make>
to make all of the executables.

And for my late submissions, since the deadline for this assignment was midnight
on the 17th of October (Monday), and I submitted this the night of October 21st 
(Friday), I should only receive a 4% deduction in my grade.

Hope whoever is grading this has a lovely day :)
